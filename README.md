## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Demonstrate proficiency in Python for data analysis.
- Showcase ability to create dynamic, user-friendly visualizations in Tableau.
- Provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

---

## 🔍 Insights Targeted
- **Objectives:**
  - Understand the relationship between weather conditions (temperature, wind speed) and bike-sharing usage.
  - Analyze seasonal and temporal trends in bike-sharing.
  - Identify peak usage periods and influencing factors.

- **Derived Insights:**
  - Higher bike usage corresponds to moderate temperature ranges (approximately 12-20°C).
  - Lower wind speeds generally correlate with increased bike usage.
  - Usage shows clear seasonal trends with peak rides occurring during warmer months.

- **Dashboard Contribution:**
  - Interactive filters and dynamic moving average parameters allowed a detailed exploration of temporal trends.
  - Heatmap visualizations effectively highlighted relationships between environmental conditions and bike usage.
  - Tooltips provided quick contextual insights, breaking down usage by weather and hour, enabling deeper understanding of user behavior.

## 🚀 Key Steps Performed

### 1. Data Collection
- Programmatically downloaded London bike-sharing dataset from Kaggle using Kaggle API.

### 2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Loaded and inspected data using pandas.
- Renamed columns for clarity.
- Converted humidity percentages and mapped numerical codes to descriptive labels.
- Exported the cleaned dataset to Excel for visualization purposes.

### 3. Data Visualization and Dashboard
- Created interactive and dynamic visualizations in Tableau, including:
  - Moving average analysis with dynamic parameters (days/weeks/months).
  - Temperature vs wind speed heatmap.
  - Interactive timeline filtering.
  - Additional insights in tooltips (bike rides segmented by weather and hour).
