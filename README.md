## 🚀 Key Steps Performed

### 1. Data Collection
- Programmatically downloaded London bike-sharing dataset from Kaggle using Kaggle API.

### 2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Loaded and inspected data using pandas.
- Renamed columns for clarity.
- Converted humidity percentages and mapped numerical codes to descriptive labels.
- Exported the cleaned dataset to Excel for visualization purposes.

### 3. Data Visualization and Dashboard
- Created interactive and dynamic visualizations in Tableau, including:
  - Moving average analysis with dynamic parameters (days/weeks/months).
  - Temperature vs wind speed heatmap.
  - Interactive timeline filtering.
  - Additional insights in tooltips (bike rides segmented by weather and hour).
